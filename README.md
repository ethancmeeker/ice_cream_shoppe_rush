# Overview

This is a game coded in python using the arcade library. It's an ice cream cone making game where you click the ice cream and toppings the customer wants on their order. If you mess up or run out of time, the customer gets mad/sad and gives you no points. If you make the order in the given time (difficulties change the amount of time), they are happy and give you points (normally 5 but with a chance to tip depedning on how fast you made the cone). 

A big part of games is using logic to tell if you can do something (a lot of booleans mainly). This project, I wanted to test my use of logic and managing it well enough to make a functioning game. I also wanted to work on my front end abilities by making everything look really nice. Each of the sprites/background where created by me and I think they turned out great. The design is cute and appeals to the eye with fun looking sprites and bright colors.
